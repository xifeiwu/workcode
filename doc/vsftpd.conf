VSFTPD.CONF(5)                                                  VSFTPD.CONF(5)

       vsftpd.conf - config file for vsftpd

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       vsftpd.conf  may  be  used  to  control  various  aspects  of  vsftpd’s
       behaviour. By default, vsftpd looks  for  this  file  at  the  location
       //eettcc//vvssffttppdd//vvssffttppdd..ccoonnff.   However, you may override this by specifying
       a command line argument to vsftpd. The command  line  argument  is  the
       pathname of the configuration file for vsftpd. This behaviour is useful
       because you may wish to use an advanced inetd such as xxiinneettdd to  launch
       vsftpd  with different configuration files on a per virtual host basis.


FFOORRMMAATT
       The format of vsftpd.conf is very simple. Each line is either a comment
       or  a directive. Comment lines start with a # and are ignored. A direc-
       tive line has the format:

       option=value

       It is important to note that it is an error to put  any  space  between
       the option, = and value.

       Each  setting  has  a  compiled in default which may be modified in the
       configuration file.


BBOOOOLLEEAANN OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Below is a list of boolean options. The value for a boolean option  may
       be set to YYEESS or NNOO.


       aallllooww__aannoonn__ssssll
              Only  applies  if ssssll__eennaabbllee is active. If set to YES, anonymous
              users will be allowed to use secured SSL connections.

              Default: NO

       aannoonn__mmkkddiirr__wwrriittee__eennaabbllee
              If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to  create  new
              directories  under  certain  conditions.  For  this to work, the
              option wwrriittee__eennaabbllee must be activated,  and  the  anonymous  ftp
              user must have write permission on the parent directory.

              Default: NO

       aannoonn__ootthheerr__wwrriittee__eennaabbllee
              If  set  to  YES,  anonymous  users will be permitted to perform
              write operations other than upload and create directory, such as
              deletion  and  renaming.  This  is generally not recommended but
              included for completeness.

              Default: NO

       aannoonn__uuppllooaadd__eennaabbllee
              If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to upload files
              under   certain   conditions.  For  this  to  work,  the  option
              wwrriittee__eennaabbllee must be activated, and the anonymous ftp user  must
              have  write permission on desired upload locations. This setting
              is also required for virtual users to upload; by  default,  vir-
              tual   users   are   treated   with  anonymous  (i.e.  maximally
              restricted) privilege.

              Default: NO

       aannoonn__wwoorrlldd__rreeaaddaabbllee__oonnllyy
              When enabled, anonymous users will only be allowed  to  download
              files which are world readable. This is recognising that the ftp
              user may own files, especially in the presence of uploads.

              Default: YES

       aannoonnyymmoouuss__eennaabbllee
              Controls whether anonymous  logins  are  permitted  or  not.  If
              enabled,  both the usernames ffttpp and aannoonnyymmoouuss are recognised as
              anonymous logins.

              Default: YES

       aasscciiii__ddoowwnnllooaadd__eennaabbllee
              When enabled, ASCII mode data  transfers  will  be  honoured  on
              downloads.

              Default: NO

       aasscciiii__uuppllooaadd__eennaabbllee
              When  enabled,  ASCII  mode  data  transfers will be honoured on
              uploads.

              Default: NO

       aassyynncc__aabboorr__eennaabbllee
              When enabled, a special FTP command known as "async  ABOR"  will
              be enabled.  Only ill advised FTP clients will use this feature.
              Additionally, this feature is awkward to handle, so it  is  dis-
              abled by default. Unfortunately, some FTP clients will hang when
              cancelling a transfer unless this feature is available,  so  you
              may wish to enable it.

              Default: NO

       bbaacckkggrroouunndd
              When  enabled,  and  vsftpd  is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd
              will background the listener process. i.e. control will  immedi-
              ately be returned to the shell which launched vsftpd.

              Default: YES

       cchheecckk__sshheellll
              Note!  This  option  only  has  an  effect for non-PAM builds of
              vsftpd. If disabled, vsftpd will not  check  /etc/shells  for  a
              valid user shell for local logins.

              Default: YES

       cchhmmoodd__eennaabbllee
              When  enabled,  allows use of the SITE CHMOD command. NOTE! This
              only applies to local users. Anonymous users never  get  to  use
              SITE CHMOD.

              Default: YES

       cchhoowwnn__uuppllooaaddss
              If  enabled, all anonymously uploaded files will have the owner-
              ship changed to the user specified in  the  setting  cchhoowwnn__uusseerr--
              nnaammee.   This is useful from an administrative, and perhaps secu-
              rity, standpoint.

              Default: NO

       cchhrroooott__lliisstt__eennaabbllee
              If activated, you may provide a list  of  local  users  who  are
              placed  in  a  chroot() jail in their home directory upon login.
              The meaning is slightly different if chroot_local_user is set to
              YES.  In  this  case, the list becomes a list of users which are
              NOT to be placed in a chroot() jail.  By default, the file  con-
              taining  this list is /etc/vsftpd/chroot_list, but you may over-
              ride this with the cchhrroooott__lliisstt__ffiillee setting.

              Default: NO

       cchhrroooott__llooccaall__uusseerr
              If set to YES, local users will be  (by  default)  placed  in  a
              chroot()  jail  in  their  home directory after login.  WWaarrnniinngg::
              This option has security implications, especially if  the  users
              have upload permission, or shell access. Only enable if you know
              what you are doing.  Note that these security  implications  are
              not  vsftpd  specific. They apply to all FTP daemons which offer
              to put local users in chroot() jails.

              Default: NO

       ccoonnnneecctt__ffrroomm__ppoorrtt__2200
              This controls whether PORT style data connections  use  port  20
              (ftp-data)  on  the  server  machine. For security reasons, some
              clients may insist that this is the case. Conversely,  disabling
              this  option enables vsftpd to run with slightly less privilege.

              Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)

       ddeebbuugg__ssssll
              If true, OpenSSL connection diagnostics are dumped to the vsftpd
              log file.  (Added in v2.0.6).

              Default: NO

       ddeelleettee__ffaaiilleedd__uuppllooaaddss
              If  true,  any  failed  upload  files  are  deleted.   (Added in
              v2.0.7).

              Default: NO

       ddeennyy__eemmaaiill__eennaabbllee
              If activated, you may provide a list of  anonymous  password  e-
              mail  responses  which cause login to be denied. By default, the
              file containing this list is /etc/vsftpd/banned_emails, but  you
              may override this with the bbaannnneedd__eemmaaiill__ffiillee setting.

              Default: NO

       ddiirrlliisstt__eennaabbllee
              If  set  to NO, all directory list commands will give permission
              denied.

              Default: YES

       ddiirrmmeessssaaggee__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, users of the FTP server can be shown  messages  when
              they  first  enter  a  new directory. By default, a directory is
              scanned for the file .message, but that may be  overridden  with
              the configuration setting mmeessssaaggee__ffiillee.

              Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)

       ddoowwnnllooaadd__eennaabbllee
              If set to NO, all download requests will give permission denied.

              Default: YES

       dduuaall__lloogg__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, two log files are generated in  parallel,  going  by
              default to //vvaarr//lloogg//xxffeerrlloogg and //vvaarr//lloogg//vvssffttppdd..lloogg.  The former
              is a wu-ftpd style transfer log, parseable  by  standard  tools.
              The latter is vsftpd’s own style log.

              Default: NO

       ffoorrccee__ddoott__ffiilleess
              If  activated,  files  and  directories  starting with . will be
              shown in directory listings even if the "a" flag was not used by
              the client. This override excludes the "." and ".." entries.

              Default: NO

       ffoorrccee__aannoonn__ddaattaa__ssssll
              Only  applies  if  ssssll__eennaabbllee  is  activated.  If activated, all
              anonymous logins are forced to use a secure  SSL  connection  in
              order to send and receive data on data connections.

              Default: NO

       ffoorrccee__aannoonn__llooggiinnss__ssssll
              Only  applies  if  ssssll__eennaabbllee  is  activated.  If activated, all
              anonymous logins are forced to use a secure  SSL  connection  in
              order to send the password.

              Default: NO

       ffoorrccee__llooccaall__ddaattaa__ssssll
              Only  applies if ssssll__eennaabbllee is activated. If activated, all non-
              anonymous logins are forced to use a secure  SSL  connection  in
              order to send and receive data on data connections.

              Default: YES

       ffoorrccee__llooccaall__llooggiinnss__ssssll
              Only  applies if ssssll__eennaabbllee is activated. If activated, all non-
              anonymous logins are forced to use a secure  SSL  connection  in
              order to send the password.

              Default: YES

       gguueesstt__eennaabbllee
              If  enabled,  all  non-anonymous  logins  are classed as "guest"
              logins. A guest login is remapped to the user specified  in  the
              gguueesstt__uusseerrnnaammee setting.

              Default: NO

       hhiiddee__iiddss
              If enabled, all user and group information in directory listings
              will be displayed as "ftp".

              Default: NO

       iimmpplliicciitt__ssssll
              If enabled, an SSL handshake is the first thing  expect  on  all
              connections  (the FTPS protocol). To support explicit SSL and/or
              plain text too, a separate vsftpd  listener  process  should  be
              run.

              Default: NO

       lliisstteenn If  enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. This means that
              vsftpd must not be run from an inetd of some kind. Instead,  the
              vsftpd  executable is run once directly. vsftpd itself will then
              take care of listening for and handling incoming connections.

              Default: NO

       lliisstteenn__iippvv66
              Like the listen parameter, except vsftpd will listen on an  IPv6
              socket  instead  of  an  IPv4 one. This parameter and the listen
              parameter are mutually exclusive.

              Default: NO

       llooccaall__eennaabbllee
              Controls whether local logins are permitted or not. If  enabled,
              normal user accounts in /etc/passwd (or wherever your PAM config
              references) may be used to log in. This must be enable  for  any
              non-anonymous login to work, including virtual users.

              Default: NO

       lloocckk__uuppllooaadd__ffiilleess
              When  enabled,  all  uploads  proceed  with  a write lock on the
              upload file. All downloads proceed with a shared  read  lock  on
              the download file. WARNING!  Before enabling this, be aware that
              malicious readers could starve a writer wanting to e.g. append a
              file.

              Default: YES

       lloogg__ffttpp__pprroottooccooll
              When enabled, all FTP requests and responses are logged, provid-
              ing the option xferlog_std_format is  not  enabled.  Useful  for
              debugging.

              Default: NO

       llss__rreeccuurrssee__eennaabbllee
              When  enabled,  this setting will allow the use of "ls -R". This
              is a minor security risk, because a ls -R at the top level of  a
              large site may consume a lot of resources.

              Default: NO

       mmddttmm__wwrriittee
              When enabled, this setting will allow MDTM to set file modifica-
              tion times (subject to the usual access checks).

              Default: YES

       nnoo__aannoonn__ppaasssswwoorrdd
              When enabled, this prevents vsftpd from asking for an  anonymous
              password - the anonymous user will log straight in.

              Default: NO

       nnoo__lloogg__lloocckk
              When  enabled, this prevents vsftpd from taking a file lock when
              writing to log  files.  This  option  should  generally  not  be
              enabled.  It  exists to workaround operating system bugs such as
              the Solaris / Veritas  filesystem  combination  which  has  been
              observed to sometimes exhibit hangs trying to lock log files.

              Default: NO

       oonnee__pprroocceessss__mmooddeell
              If  you have a Linux 2.4 kernel, it is possible to use a differ-
              ent security model which only uses one process  per  connection.
              It is a less pure security model, but gains you performance. You
              really don’t want to enable this unless you know  what  you  are
              doing,  and  your  site  supports huge numbers of simultaneously
              connected users.

              Default: NO

       ppaasssswwdd__cchhrroooott__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, along with cchhrroooott__llooccaall__uusseerr , then a chroot()  jail
              location  may be specified on a per-user basis. Each user’s jail
              is derived from their home directory string in /etc/passwd.  The
              occurrence  of /./ in the home directory string denotes that the
              jail is at that particular location in the path.

              Default: NO

       ppaassvv__aaddddrr__rreessoollvvee
              Set to YES if you want to use  a  hostname  (as  opposed  to  IP
              address) in the ppaassvv__aaddddrreessss option.

              Default: NO

       ppaassvv__eennaabbllee
              Set to NO if you want to disallow the PASV method of obtaining a
              data connection.

              Default: YES

       ppaassvv__pprroommiissccuuoouuss
              Set to YES if you want to disable the PASV security  check  that
              ensures  the data connection originates from the same IP address
              as the control connection.  Only enable if you know what you are
              doing!  The  only  legitimate  use  for  this is in some form of
              secure tunnelling scheme, or perhaps to facilitate FXP  support.

              Default: NO

       ppoorrtt__eennaabbllee
              Set to NO if you want to disallow the PORT method of obtaining a
              data connection.

              Default: YES

       ppoorrtt__pprroommiissccuuoouuss
              Set to YES if you want to disable the PORT security  check  that
              ensures  that  outgoing data connections can only connect to the
              client. Only enable if you know what you are doing!

              Default: NO

       rreeqquuiirree__cceerrtt
              If set to yes,  all  SSL  client  connections  are  required  to
              present  a  client certificate. The degree of validation applied
              to this certificate is controlled  by  vvaalliiddaattee__cceerrtt  (Added  in
              v2.0.6).

              Default: NO

       rreeqquuiirree__ssssll__rreeuussee
              If  set to yes, all SSL data connections are required to exhibit
              SSL session reuse (which proves that they know the  same  master
              secret  as  the  control  channel).  Although  this  is a secure
              default, it may break many FTP clients, so you may want to  dis-
              able it. For a discussion of the consequences, see http://scary-
              beastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html
              (Added in v2.1.0).

              Default: YES

       rreevveerrssee__llooookkuupp__eennaabbllee
              Set  to  YES if you want vsftpd to transform the ip address into
              the hostname, before pam authentication. This is useful  if  you
              use pam_access including the hostname. If you want vsftpd to run
              on the environment where the reverse lookup for some hostname is
              available  and  the name server doesn’t respond for a while, you
              should set this to NO to avoid a performance issue.

              Default: YES

       rruunn__aass__llaauunncchhiinngg__uusseerr
              Set to YES if you want vsftpd to run as the user which  launched
              vsftpd.  This is useful where root access is not available. MAS-
              SIVE WARNING! Do NOT enable this option unless you totally  know
              what  you are doing, as naive use of this option can create mas-
              sive security problems. Specifically, vsftpd does not  /  cannot
              use  chroot  technology to restrict file access when this option
              is set (even if launched by root). A poor substitute could be to
              use  a  ddeennyy__ffiillee setting such as {/*,*..*}, but the reliability
              of this cannot compare to chroot, and should not be  relied  on.
              If  using this option, many restrictions on other options apply.
              For example, options requiring privilege such  as  non-anonymous
              logins,  upload  ownership changing, connecting from port 20 and
              listen ports less than 1024 are  not  expected  to  work.  Other
              options may be impacted.

              Default: NO

       sseeccuurree__eemmaaiill__lliisstt__eennaabbllee
              Set to YES if you want only a specified list of e-mail passwords
              for anonymous logins to be accepted. This is useful  as  a  low-
              hassle way of restricting access to low-security content without
              needing virtual users. When enabled, anonymous logins  are  pre-
              vented unless the password provided is listed in the file speci-
              fied by the eemmaaiill__ppaasssswwoorrdd__ffiillee setting. The file format is  one
              password  per line, no extra whitespace. The default filename is
              /etc/vsftpd/email_passwords.

              Default: NO

       sseessssiioonn__ssuuppppoorrtt
              This controls whether vsftpd attempts to maintain  sessions  for
              logins.  If  vsftpd  is  maintaining  sessions,  it will try and
              update utmp and wtmp. It will also open a pam_session  if  using
              PAM  to  authenticate,  and only close this upon logout. You may
              wish to disable this if you do not need session logging, and you
              wish  to give vsftpd more opportunity to run with less processes
              and / or less privilege. NOTE - utmp and wtmp  support  is  only
              provided with PAM enabled builds.

              Default: NO

       sseettpprrooccttiittllee__eennaabbllee
              If  enabled, vsftpd will try and show session status information
              in the system process listing. In other words, the reported name
              of  the  process will change to reflect what a vsftpd session is
              doing (idle, downloading etc). You probably want to  leave  this
              off for security purposes.

              Default: NO

       ssssll__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, and vsftpd was compiled against OpenSSL, vsftpd will
              support secure connections via SSL. This applies to the  control
              connection  (including  login) and also data connections. You’ll
              need a client with SSL support too. NOTE!!  Beware enabling this
              option.  Only enable it if you need it. vsftpd can make no guar-
              antees about the security of the OpenSSL libraries. By  enabling
              this  option,  you  are declaring that you trust the security of
              your installed OpenSSL library.

              Default: NO

       ssssll__rreeqquueesstt__cceerrtt
              If enabled, vsftpd will request (but  not  necessarily  require;

              lytthhiiss should not cause any trouble at all, but IBM zOS seems to
              have issues.  (New in v2.0.7).

              Default: YES

       ssssll__ssssllvv22
              Only applies if ssssll__eennaabbllee is activated. If enabled, this option
              will permit SSL v2 protocol connections.  TLS v1 connections are
              preferred.

              Default: NO

       ssssll__ssssllvv33
              Only applies if ssssll__eennaabbllee is activated. If enabled, this option
              will permit SSL v3 protocol connections.  TLS v1 connections are
              preferred.

              Default: NO

       ssssll__ttllssvv11
              Only applies if ssssll__eennaabbllee is activated. If enabled, this option
              will permit TLS v1 protocol connections.  TLS v1 connections are
              preferred.

              Default: YES

       ssttrriicctt__ssssll__rreeaadd__eeooff
              If  enabled, SSL data uploads are required to terminate via SSL,
              not an EOF on the socket. This option is  required  to  be  sure
              that  an attacker did not terminate an upload prematurely with a
              faked TCP FIN. Unfortunately,  it  is  not  enabled  by  default
              because so few clients get it right. (New in v2.0.7).

              Default: NO

       ssttrriicctt__ssssll__wwrriittee__sshhuuttddoowwnn
              If  enabled,  SSL  data  downloads are required to terminate via
              SSL, not an EOF on the socket. This is off by default as  I  was
              unable  to find a single FTP client that does this. It is minor.
              All it affects is our ability to tell whether  the  client  con-
              firmed  full  receipt of the file. Even without this option, the
              client is able to check the integrity of the download.  (New  in
              v2.0.7).

              Default: NO

       ssyysslloogg__eennaabbllee
              If  enabled,  then  any  log  output  which  would  have gone to
              /var/log/vsftpd.log goes to the system log instead.  Logging  is
              done under the FTPD facility.

              Default: NO

       ttccpp__wwrraappppeerrss
              If  enabled,  and vsftpd was compiled with tcp_wrappers support,
              incoming connections will be  fed  through  tcp_wrappers  access
              control. Furthermore, there is a mechanism for per-IP based con-
              figuration. If tcp_wrappers sets the  VSFTPD_LOAD_CONF  environ-
              ment  variable,  then  the  vsftpd session will try and load the
              vsftpd configuration file specified in this variable.

              Default: NO

       tteexxtt__uusseerrddbb__nnaammeess
              By default, numeric IDs are shown in the user and  group  fields
              of  directory  listings.  You  can get textual names by enabling
              this parameter. It is off by default for performance reasons.

              Default: NO

       ttiillddee__uusseerr__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, vsftpd  will  try  and  resolve  pathnames  such  as
              ~chris/pics,  i.e.  a  tilde  followed  by a username. Note that
              vsftpd will always resolve the pathnames ~ and  ~/something  (in
              this  case  the ~ resolves to the initial login directory). Note
              that ~user paths will only resolve if the file  //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd  may
              be found within the _current_ chroot() jail.

              Default: NO

       uussee__llooccaallttiimmee
              If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time
              in your local time zone. The default  is  to  display  GMT.  The
              times returned by the MDTM FTP command are also affected by this
              option.

              Default: NO

       uussee__sseennddffiillee
              An internal setting used for testing  the  relative  benefit  of
              using the sendfile() system call on your platform.

              Default: YES

       uusseerrlliisstt__ddeennyy
              This  option is examined if uusseerrlliisstt__eennaabbllee is activated. If you
              set this setting to NO, then users will be denied  login  unless
              they   are   explicitly   listed   in   the  file  specified  by
              uusseerrlliisstt__ffiillee.  When login  is  denied,  the  denial  is  issued
              before the user is asked for a password.

              Default: YES

       uusseerrlliisstt__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, vsftpd will load a list of usernames, from the file-
              name given by uusseerrlliisstt__ffiillee.  If a user tries to log in using  a
              name in this file, they will be denied before they are asked for
              a password. This may be useful in preventing cleartext passwords
              being transmitted. See also uusseerrlliisstt__ddeennyy.

              Default: NO

       vvaalliiddaattee__cceerrtt
              If  set  to yes, all SSL client certificates received must vali-
              date OK.  Self-signed certs do  not  constitute  OK  validation.
              (New in v2.0.6).

              Default: NO

       uusseerrlliisstt__lloogg
              This  option  is  examined  if  uusseerrlliisstt__eennaabbllee is activated. If
              enabled, every login denial based  on  the  user  list  will  be
              logged.

              Default: NO

       vviirrttuuaall__uussee__llooccaall__pprriivvss
              If  enabled, virtual users will use the same privileges as local
              users. By default, virtual users will use the same privileges as
              anonymous  users, which tends to be more restrictive (especially
              in terms of write access).

              Default: NO

       wwrriittee__eennaabbllee
              This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesys-
              tem  are  allowed  or not. These commands are: STOR, DELE, RNFR,
              RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE and SITE.

              Default: NO

       xxffeerrlloogg__eennaabbllee
              If enabled, a log file will be maintained detailling uploads and
              downloads.    By   default,   this   file   will  be  placed  at
              /var/log/vsftpd.log, but this location may be  overridden  using
              the configuration setting vvssffttppdd__lloogg__ffiillee.

              Default: NO (but the sample config file enables it)

       xxffeerrlloogg__ssttdd__ffoorrmmaatt
              If  enabled,  the  transfer log file will be written in standard
              xferlog format, as used by wu-ftpd. This is useful  because  you
              can  reuse  existing transfer statistics generators. The default
              format is more readable, however. The default location for  this
              style  of  log  file  is /var/log/xferlog, but you may change it
              with the setting xxffeerrlloogg__ffiillee.

              Default: NO

       iissoollaattee__nneettwwoorrkk
              If enabled, use CLONE_NEWNET to isolate the untrusted  processes
              so  that  they  can’t do arbitrary connect() and instead have to
              ask the privileged process for sockets (  ppoorrtt__pprroommiissccuuoouuss  have
              to be disabled).

              Default: YES

       iissoollaattee
              If  enabled,  use  CLONE_NEWPID and CLONE_NEWIPC to isolate pro-
              cesses to their ipc and pid namespaces. So  separated  processes
              can not interact with each other.

              Default: YES


NNUUMMEERRIICC OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Below  is  a list of numeric options. A numeric option must be set to a
       non negative integer. Octal numbers are supported, for  convenience  of
       the umask options. To specify an octal number, use 0 as the first digit
       of the number.


       aacccceepptt__ttiimmeeoouutt
              The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to  establish  con-
              nection with a PASV style data connection.

              Default: 60

       aannoonn__mmaaxx__rraattee
              The  maximum  data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second,
              for anonymous clients.

              Default: 0 (unlimited)

       aannoonn__uummaasskk
              The value that the umask for file creation is set to for  anony-
              mous  users. NOTE! If you want to specify octal values, remember
              the "0" prefix otherwise the value will be treated as a base  10
              integer!

              Default: 077

       cchhoowwnn__uuppllooaadd__mmooddee
              The  file  mode to force for chown()ed anonymous uploads. (Added
              in v2.0.6).

              Default: 0600

       ccoonnnneecctt__ttiimmeeoouutt
              The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to respond  to  our
              PORT style data connection.

              Default: 60

       ddaattaa__ccoonnnneeccttiioonn__ttiimmeeoouutt
              The  timeout,  in  seconds, which is roughly the maximum time we
              permit data transfers to stall for  with  no  progress.  If  the
              timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked off.

              The number of seconds to pause prior to  allowing  a  successful
              login.

              Default: 0

       ffiillee__ooppeenn__mmooddee
              The  permissions  with  which uploaded files are created. Umasks
              are applied on top of this value. You may wish to change to 0777
              if you want uploaded files to be executable.

              Default: 0666

       ffttpp__ddaattaa__ppoorrtt
              The port from which PORT style connections originate (as long as
              the poorly named ccoonnnneecctt__ffrroomm__ppoorrtt__2200 is enabled).

              Default: 20

       iiddllee__sseessssiioonn__ttiimmeeoouutt
              The timeout, in seconds, which is  the  maximum  time  a  remote
              client  may spend between FTP commands. If the timeout triggers,
              the remote client is kicked off.

              Default: 300

       lliisstteenn__ppoorrtt
              If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the port it will listen
              on for incoming FTP connections.

              Default: 21

       llooccaall__mmaaxx__rraattee
              The  maximum  data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second,
              for local authenticated users.

              Default: 0 (unlimited)

       llooccaall__uummaasskk
              The value that the umask for file creation is set to  for  local
              users.  NOTE!  If you want to specify octal values, remember the
              "0" prefix otherwise the value will be  treated  as  a  base  10
              integer!

              Default: 077

       mmaaxx__cclliieennttss
              If  vsftpd  is in standalone mode, this is the maximum number of
              clients which may be connected. Any additional clients  connect-
              ing  will  get  an  error message.  The value 0 switches off the
              limit.

              Default: 2000

       mmaaxx__llooggiinn__ffaaiillss
              After this many login failures, the session is killed.

              Default: 3

       mmaaxx__ppeerr__iipp
              If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the maximum  number  of
              clients  which  may  be  connected from the same source internet
              address. A client will get an error message if they go over this
              limit. The value 0 switches off the limit.

              Default: 50

       ppaassvv__mmaaxx__ppoorrtt
              The  maximum  port  to allocate for PASV style data connections.
              Can be used to specify a  narrow  port  range  to  assist  fire-
              walling.

              Default: 0 (use any port)

       ppaassvv__mmiinn__ppoorrtt
              The  minimum  port  to allocate for PASV style data connections.
              Can be used to specify a  narrow  port  range  to  assist  fire-
              walling.

              Default: 0 (use any port)

       ttrraannss__cchhuunnkk__ssiizzee
              You  probably  don’t  want to change this, but try setting it to
              something like 8192 for a much smoother bandwidth limiter.

              Default: 0 (let vsftpd pick a sensible setting)


SSTTRRIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Below is a list of string options.


       aannoonn__rroooott
              This option represents a directory  which  vsftpd  will  try  to
              change  into  after  an  anonymous  login.  Failure  is silently
              ignored.

              Default: (none)

       bbaannnneedd__eemmaaiill__ffiillee
              This option is the name of a file containing a list of anonymous
              e-mail passwords which are not permitted. This file is consulted
              if the option ddeennyy__eemmaaiill__eennaabbllee is enabled.

              Default: /etc/vsftpd/banned_emails

       bbaannnneerr__ffiillee
              This option is the name of a file  containing  text  to  display
              when  someone  connects  to the server. If set, it overrides the
              banner string provided by the ffttppdd__bbaannnneerr option.

              Default: (none)

       ccaa__cceerrttss__ffiillee
              This option is the name of a file to load Certificate  Authority
              certs  from,  for  the  purpose  of validating client certs. The
              loaded certs are also advertised to the  client,  to  cater  for
              TLSv1.0  clients  such as the z/OS FTP client.  Regrettably, the
              default SSL CA cert paths are not used, because of vsftpd’s  use
              of restricted filesystem spaces (chroot). (Added in v2.0.6).

              Default: (none)

       cchhoowwnn__uusseerrnnaammee
              This  is  the  name of the user who is given ownership of anony-
              mously uploaded files. This option is only relevant  if  another
              option, cchhoowwnn__uuppllooaaddss, is set.

              Default: root

       cchhrroooott__lliisstt__ffiillee
              The  option  is  the  name  of a file containing a list of local
              users which will be placed in a  chroot()  jail  in  their  home
              directory.   This   option   is  only  relevant  if  the  option
              cchhrroooott__lliisstt__eennaabbllee is enabled. If the  option  cchhrroooott__llooccaall__uusseerr
              is  enabled,  then  the list file becomes a list of users to NOT
              place in a chroot() jail.

              Default: /etvsftpd.confc/vsftpd.chroot_list

       ccmmddss__aalllloowweedd
              This options specifies a comma separated  list  of  allowed  FTP
              commands  (post login. USER, PASS and QUIT and others are always
              allowed pre-login). Other commands are rejected. This is a  pow-
              erful  method  of  really  locking  down an FTP server. Example:
              cmds_allowed=PASV,RETR,QUIT

              Default: (none)

       ccmmddss__ddeenniieedd
              This options specifies a comma separated list of denied FTP com-
              mands  (post  login.  USER,  PASS,  QUIT  and  others are always
              allowed pre-login). If  a  command  appears  on  both  this  and
              ccmmddss__aalllloowweedd   then  the  denial  takes  precedence.  (Added  in
              v2.1.0).

              Default: (none)

       ddeennyy__ffiillee
              This option can be used to set  a  pattern  for  filenames  (and
              directory names etc.) which should not be accessible in any way.
              The affected items are not hidden, but any attempt  to  do  any-
              thing to them (download, change into directory, affect something
              within directory etc.) will  be  denied.  This  option  is  very
              simple,  and should not be used for serious access control - the
              filesystem’s permissions should be used in preference.  However,
              this  option  may  be  useful in certain virtual user setups. In
              particular aware that if a filename is accessible by  a  variety
              of  names  (perhaps  due  to symbolic links or hard links), then
              care must be taken to deny access to all the names.  Access will
              be  denied  to  items if their name contains the string given by
              hide_file, or if they match the regular expression specified  by
              hide_file.   Note that vsftpd’s regular expression matching code
              is a simple implementation which is a  subset  of  full  regular
              expression  functionality.  Because  of  this,  you will need to
              carefully and exhaustively test any application of this  option.
              And  you  are  recommended to use filesystem permissions for any
              important security policies due to  their  greater  reliability.
              Supported  regex  syntax  is any number of *, ? and unnested {,}
              operators. Regex matching is only supported on the  last  compo-
              nent of a path, e.g. a/b/? is supported but a/?/c is not.  Exam-
              ple: deny_file={*.mp3,*.mov,.private}

              Default: (none)

       ddssaa__cceerrtt__ffiillee
              This option specifies the location of the DSA certificate to use
              for SSL encrypted connections.

              Default: (none - an RSA certificate suffices)

       ddssaa__pprriivvaattee__kkeeyy__ffiillee
              This option specifies the location of the DSA private key to use
              for SSL encrypted connections. If this option is  not  set,  the
              private  key  is expected to be in the same file as the certifi-
              cate.

              Default: (none)

       eemmaaiill__ppaasssswwoorrdd__ffiillee
              This option can be used to provide an alternate file  for  usage
              by the sseeccuurree__eemmaaiill__lliisstt__eennaabbllee setting.

              Default: /etc/vsftpd/email_passwords

       ffttpp__uusseerrnnaammee
              This  is the name of the user we use for handling anonymous FTP.
              The home directory of this user is the root of the anonymous FTP
              area.

              Default: ftp

       ffttppdd__bbaannnneerr
              This  string  option  allows you to override the greeting banner
              displayed by vsftpd when a connection first comes in.

              Default: (none - default vsftpd banner is displayed)

       gguueesstt__uusseerrnnaammee
              See the boolean setting gguueesstt__eennaabbllee for a description  of  what
              constitutes  a  guest  login.  This setting is the real username
              which guest users are mapped to.

              Default: ftp

       hhiiddee__ffiillee
              This option can be used to set  a  pattern  for  filenames  (and
              directory  names  etc.)  which  should  be hidden from directory
              listings. Despite being hidden, the files / directories etc. are
              fully accessible to clients who know what names to actually use.
              Items will be hidden if their names contain the string given  by
              hide_file,  or if they match the regular expression specified by
              hide_file. Note that vsftpd’s regular expression  matching  code
              is  a  simple  implementation  which is a subset of full regular
              expression functionality.  See ddeennyy__ffiillee for details of  exactly
              what regex syntax is supported.  Example: hide_file={*.mp3,.hid-
              den,hide*,h?}

              Default: (none)

       lliisstteenn__aaddddrreessss
              If vsftpd is in standalone mode, the default listen address  (of
              all local interfaces) may be overridden by this setting. Provide
              a numeric IP address.

              Default: (none)

       lliisstteenn__aaddddrreessss66
              Like listen_address, but specifies a default listen address  for
              the  IPv6 listener (which is used if listen_ipv6 is set). Format
              is standard IPv6 address format.

              Default: (none)

       llooccaall__rroooott
              This option represents a directory  which  vsftpd  will  try  to
              change into after a local (i.e. non-anonymous) login. Failure is
              silently ignored.

              Default: (none)

       mmeessssaaggee__ffiillee
              This option is the name of the file  we  look  for  when  a  new
              directory  is  entered. The contents are displayed to the remote
              user. This  option  is  only  relevant  if  the  option  ddiirrmmeess--
              ssaaggee__eennaabbllee is enabled.

              Default: .message

       nnoopprriivv__uusseerr
              This  is  the  name  of  the user that is used by vsftpd when it
              wants to be totally unprivileged. Note that  this  should  be  a
              dedicated  user, rather than nobody. The user nobody tends to be
              used for rather a lot of important things on most machines.

              Default: nobody

       ppaamm__sseerrvviiccee__nnaammee
              This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.

              Default: ftp

       ppaassvv__aaddddrreessss
              Use this option to override the  IP  address  that  vsftpd  will
              advertise  in response to the PASV command. Provide a numeric IP
              address, unless ppaassvv__aaddddrr__rreessoollvvee is enabled, in which case  you
              can  provide  a  hostname  which will be DNS resolved for you at
              startup.

              Default: (none - the address is taken  from  the  incoming  con-
              nected socket)

       rrssaa__cceerrtt__ffiillee
              This option specifies the location of the RSA certificate to use
              for SSL encrypted connections.

              Default: /usr/share/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem

       rrssaa__pprriivvaattee__kkeeyy__ffiillee
              This option specifies the location of the RSA private key to use
              for  SSL  encrypted  connections. If this option is not set, the
              private  key  is  expected  to  be  in  the  same  file  as  the
              certificate.

              Default: (none)

       sseeccuurree__cchhrroooott__ddiirr
              This  option  should  be the name of a directory which is empty.
              Also, the directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This
              directory is used as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does
              not require filesystem access.

              Default: /usr/share/empty

       ssssll__cciipphheerrss
              This option can be used to select which SSL ciphers vsftpd  will
              allow  for  encrypted  SSL connections. See the cciipphheerrss man page
              for further details. Note that restricting ciphers can be a use-
              ful  security precaution as it prevents malicious remote parties
              forcing a cipher which they have found problems with.

              Default: DES-CBC3-SHA

       uusseerr__ccoonnffiigg__ddiirr
              This powerful option allows the override of  any  config  option
              specified in the manual page, on a per-user basis. Usage is sim-
              ple, and is  best  illustrated  with  an  example.  If  you  set
              uusseerr__ccoonnffiigg__ddiirr  to  be //eettcc//vvssffttppdd//uusseerr__ccoonnff and then log on as
              the user "chris", then vsftpd will apply  the  settings  in  the
              file  //eettcc//vvssffttppdd//uusseerr__ccoonnff//cchhrriiss  for  the duration of the ses-
              sion. The format of this file is  as  detailed  in  this  manual
              page!  PLEASE NOTE that not all settings are effective on a per-
              user basis. For example, many settings only prior to the  user’s
              session  being  started.  Examples  of  settings  which will not
              affect any behviour on a per-user basis include  listen_address,
              banner_file, max_per_ip, max_clients, xferlog_file, etc.

       uusseerr__ssuubb__ttookkeenn
              This  option  is useful is conjunction with virtual users. It is
              used to automatically generate a home directory for each virtual
              user, based on a template. For example, if the home directory of
              the  real  user  specified  via  gguueesstt__uusseerrnnaammee  is   //hhoommee//vviirr--
              ttuuaall//$$UUSSEERR,  and  uusseerr__ssuubb__ttookkeenn is set to $$UUSSEERR, then when vir-
              tual user fred logs in, he will end up (usually chroot()’ed)  in
              the directory //hhoommee//vviirrttuuaall//ffrreedd.  This option also takes affect
              if llooccaall__rroooott contains uusseerr__ssuubb__ttookkeenn.

              Default: (none)

       uusseerrlliisstt__ffiillee
              This  option  is  the  name  of  the  file   loaded   when   the
              uusseerrlliisstt__eennaabbllee option is active.

              Default: /etc/vsftpd/user_list

       vvssffttppdd__lloogg__ffiillee
              This option is the name of the file to which we write the vsftpd
              style log file. This log is only written  if  the  option  xxffeerr--
              lloogg__eennaabbllee  is  set, and xxffeerrlloogg__ssttdd__ffoorrmmaatt is NOT set. Alterna-
              tively,  it  is   written   if   you   have   set   the   option
              dduuaall__lloogg__eennaabbllee.   One  further  complication  - if you have set
              ssyysslloogg__eennaabbllee, then this file is not written and output is  sent
              to the system log instead.

              Default: /var/log/vsftpd.log

       xxffeerrlloogg__ffiillee
              This  option  is  the name of the file to which we write the wu-
              ftpd style transfer log. The transfer log is only written if the
              option  xxffeerrlloogg__eennaabbllee  is  set,  along with xxffeerrlloogg__ssttdd__ffoorrmmaatt.
              Alternatively,  it  is  written  if  you  have  set  the  option
              dduuaall__lloogg__eennaabbllee.

              Default: /var/log/xferlog
