<p>There was an old man from Swindon,<br/>
    A place that rhymed only with 'pinned on,'<br/>
    Okay, well that's fine,<br/>
    Until the fifth line,<br/>
    At which point â€¦ well, I'm totally out of luck.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, having failed miserably to manage something as simple as
    "order a breakfast and pay for it," we set about our next task:
    submitting a visa application for our impending visit to
    Thailand. Heaven help us! We're not normally scatty like this,
    so we really must have needed that breakfast!
<p>Thankfully, the rest of the day was nothing like our poor start.
    We got the visa submitted and approved without a hitch, so
    that's one less task for us to do now.
