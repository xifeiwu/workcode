The current version 3.0.x
-------------------------
A fresh design, lots of novel ideas, and a greatly expanded new version of the framework.

As you might have suspected from the jump in version numbers, the latest version has many improvements and a few important changes. The most important point is certainly the completely reworked, bilingual documentation of the framework -- now available in both German and English. But not only that: YAML 3 offers a greatly simplified file structure, even more resilience and accessibility in the CSS components, speed-optimized versions of the components for the live server, as well as numerous new layout examples. 

A detailed overview of all the new functions and modifications to the new version is available in the Changelog.
